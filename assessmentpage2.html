	<h1> <u> Types of cyberattacks </u> </h1>
	
	<!-- information -->
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	There are many different methods that hackers can use to either disrupt and take down a system or to collect information. These include 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> Malware attacks</b></li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	Malware attacks are the most common kind of cyberattack. This is when a malicious piece of software which could be a virus, trojan, worm or some other harmful software finds its way onto the victims device.<br>
	This is usually occurs when the user clicks on an infected link which could be within an email attatchment. This causes the malware to be downloaded onto the device either intercepting data without the victim knowing or it could
	lock the user out of the device using ransomware. To regain access to the computer the user usually has to pay a certain price to the attacker.
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"> <b> Phishing </b> </li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	Phising is when the attacker pretends to be a trusted individual and sends fake and harmful emails to the victim hoping that they can trick them into beliving they are the real person. This allows the attacker to either gain
	important information or include a malicious link or attachment within the email or message.
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"> <b>Denial of service</b> </li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	A DDoS attack is when attackers target certain networks or servers and flood them with large amounts of information to overwhelm and hog their bandwith. This usually leads to the server crashing or slowing down
	which will disrupt the service the company is trying to provide.
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> SQL injection </b></li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
	SQL injections are when attackers enter malicious code into a websites search or textbox causing the server to present crucial information. This normally happens due to poor validation on a website.
	</p>
	</ul>
