	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	Cyber security is where companies and individuals use technologies to reduce the risk of cyber attacks occuring on a network or device.

	Why are cyber attacks becoming increasingly important?
	</h1>
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
	As we move into a digital age the use of technology within households and buisnesses has increased dramatically. People use multiple devices that are connected to the internet everday including computers, mobile
	phones and smart devices.  <br> Each of these individual devices contain lots of important information that cyber criminals can benefit off. These include banking details, passwords, personal information and more.
	Companies must protect customer data aswell as provide a reliable service to maintain a good reputation. Many large cyberattacks have damaged the reputation of large companies. An example of this is from the password management company lastpass in 2023 where sourcecode was accessed by the attackers.
	This massively damaged their reputation leading to many customers moving to other services. <br>
	Technology is becoming increasing important in everyday society. People are dependent on technology throughout their day so cybersecurity is important to prevent people losing access to their devices.
