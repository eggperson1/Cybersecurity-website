	<h1> <u> How to reduce the risk of Cyberattacks </u> </h1>
	
	
	<!-- information -->
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	There are many ways you can reduce the impact of a cyberattack aswell as reducing the risk of them occuring in the first place. Each type of attack will require different methods to protect yourself.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> Malware attacks</b></li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	To prevent malware attacks system administrators should make sure all devices have been updated to the latest software versions as these updates usually fix exploits and bugs that can be abused.
	Firewalls can be setup to prevent harmful files being downloaded onto the device. Training should be carried out to teach staff and users of the systems and networks about the dangers of clicking on unknown links. <br>
	Antivirus software such as Avast can also be used to isolate dangerous programs.
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"> <b> Phishing </b> </li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	Phishing can be prevented by carefully checking the emails that have been sent to you. Phishing emails usually contain multiple spelling mistakes and formatting errors.
	If you are within a large company you should also make sure that the emails sent to you are coming from a business account and not externally from your company. <br> 
	They might try and trick you by copying your business accounts however they may swap one letter to another similar looking letter or group of letters for example changing the letter l to the number 1 or changing the letter W
	to two letter v's (VV). 
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"> <b>Denial of service</b> </li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	A DDoS attack is much harder to prevent yourself. You can analyse traffic on your network which will allow you to look out for any unusual behaviour.
	Large network slowdowns are a sign of a DDos attack occuring. To help ease pressure on your network you can use DDos prevention services from large cloud service providers.
	</p>
	<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> SQL injection </b></li>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
	SQL injections can be prevented through good validation on user inputs. This prevents malicious code from being ran.
	</p>
	</ul>
